# Seraph-Web

A multi-language machine learning capable indexing and library interfacing platform serving as a Solr index searching solution that is part of the Seraph.cloud network.

The web app for Seraph.cloud is known as Black Hole. Black Hole is designed to function as an indexing solution for data, images, documents, and more.

## History

Originally BlackHole was used to handle the large amounts of data encountered when dealing with directories of images and documents. The project was placed on a hold for several years until a purpose for it was found. BlackHole is now a part of Seraph.cloud. As a part of the Seraph software and data network, it functions as a user friendly interface to search indexed data at speeds faster than most search engines.

## The operation and installation of Solr, and initializing Cores, are both explained in the document /blackhole/docs/INSTALL.md

Linux Install: [#Linux](docs/INSTALL.md#ubuntudebian-other-apt-ready-distributions-of-linux)<br>
Linux Launch Command Example: [#Example](docs/INSTALL.md#example)<br>
Windows Install: [#Windows](docs/INSTALL.md#windows-windows-server)

## The library_core is for linux, win_core is obviously for windows. Mixing the two up will result in serious problems.
